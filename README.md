# NBA_Home_Adv
This repo contains the files for a project dedicated to statistically comparing the home court advantages before and after the NBA restart in the 2019-2020 season. These files include: multiple .csv files from where our data was collected, a project proposal file which served as a document where the majority of the planning was done (question, background info, hypothesis, etc.), and a final project file where the analysis took place and results were drawn.

The final version of this project can be found in the Jupyter Notebook titled <a href="./FinalProject.ipynb">FinalProject.ipynb</a>. This file includes all of the details necessary for a complete data science project.
